                    <p>Blockchain technology is a way of securely managing access and information.</p>
                        <p>The core of blockchain hinges on the idea of decentralization, which essentially distributes power and risk equitably across players in a network. Blockchain startups are finding niche and clever ways to optimize industries.

                            The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these things to connect and exchange data, creating opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based systems.</p>
